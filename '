# JacquelynQL

A series of tools to administrate and analyze quake live matches conducted on QLDS servers.

Currently this only consists of the daemon, plans are to implement a web server that collates match data and makes it easier to understand insights.

## Daemon
### Requirements
* The QLDS instance you want to monitor has both `zmq_rcon_enable` and `zmq_stats_enable` set to `1`
* a PostgreSQL server is running and that you have edited the .env file provided with the distribution to point to your psql server
* a redis server is running and that you have edited the .env file provided with the distribution to point to your redis-server instance
* The Daemon is compiled with unstable (nightly) rust

### Non-obvious behavior
* We grab most recent messages by issuing a `"noop"` command to rcon ~ every frame `~ (( 1000ms / 40) * 2)`, given that QLDS, to my understanding, cannot process events concurrently (cf the 250 fps sound bug)
* the consequence of this is that if multiple commands are sent within 25ms of eachother (not likely) then there is a chance that the server will miss one of those events (very likely)

#### Notes
* The Daemon is written to be run on the same host as the QLDS instance itself, HOWEVER, if you decide that isn't for you (say, you want to use Docker or something), then you will need to provide addresses to the zmq port via the .env file



## Frequently Made Up Questions
### Is it any good?
* [yes](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434)

### Why the name?
* I have a friend named Jacquelyn
* Jacquelyn derives from the Hebrew word for Jacob, which can be translated as 'supplanter', the intention of this project is to supplant the current mainstays of QLDS administration and match analysis, which will remain unnamed, as I think they both suck and waste my time as a server admin
